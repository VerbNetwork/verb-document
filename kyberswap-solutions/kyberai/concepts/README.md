# Concepts

KyberAI surfaces key data from a variety of sources and processes them into easily digestible formats for our users. To provide users with a comprehensive view of the markets, KyberAI draws from different data sources, each with their own trust assumptions. Moreover, our flagship KyberScore condenses all the complexities managing multiple data streams into a single number for the convenience of our users.

The following sections outline the concepts that are key to KyberAI and also sheds further light on how KyberAI is democratizing market data:

## Keep track of your favourite tokens

### Step 1: Identify tokens for price alerts

KyberAI provides multiple options for users to discover the most promising tokens. This can be through viewing [KyberAI's token rankings](discover-promising-tokens.md) or [exploring token details](deep-dive-into-token-data.md). Whichever the path taken, once you've identified a token worth tracking, you can proceed to add them to configure a price alert for the token.

### Step 2: Setup your price alert

You can configure price alerts for a token from the [Explore page](deep-dive-into-token-data.md). The price alert feature can be accessed via the alarm icon on the top right of the page.

Upon selecting the icon, the price alert configuration screen will be displayed. You can choose the token pair and price as well as the chain for which the price alert will apply to. Note that you can also setup thresholds which will act as the trigger point for the alert (i.e. price above or below a target).

# Technical Indicators

Aside from on-chain data, further price insights can also be derived via technical indicators. Such technical indicators are a result of technical analysis methods whereby pricing insights can be inferred based on charting the trends of historical market data. While history is not always repeated, the technical analysis discipline has gained significant traction amongst traders and hence the aggregate effect of the analysis is that prices will tend to move in line with technical indicators, whether or not the price movement was caused by changes to an assets fundamental value or the self-fulfilling prophecy of a horde of traders. To this end, KyberAI has made available a handful of the most important technical indicators and interactive tools which includes DeFi specific indicators such as CEX liquidations and funding rates.

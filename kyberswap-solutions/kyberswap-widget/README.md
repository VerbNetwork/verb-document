KyberSwap Widget provides users of your website with a handy tool for token swaps at superior rates. The KyberSwap Widget supports swaps across all Aggregator EVM chains. Please refer to [Supported Exchanges and Networks ](../../getting-started/supported-exchanges-and-networks.md)for the full list of supported chains.

For guides on how to integrate the KyberSwap Widget into your app, you can refer to [Integrating The KyberSwap Widget](developer-guides/integrating-the-kyberswap-widget.md).

## Example use cases

* Building a custom front-end for KyberSwap
* Swapping assets in a Defi application

## Endlessly customizable

You can customize the colors, font, and token list to match your app theme.. Alternatively, you can use our slightly modified sample `theme` to create your own look and feel.

# Aggregator API Specification

KyberSwap Aggregator exposes a set of APIs that allows developers to easily query favourable rates for a swap. This includes additional swap data such as the exact swap route, swap routing parameters, as well as the encoded data to be submitted to the Aggregator [smart contract](../contracts/aggregator-contract-addresses.md). Please refer to [Execute A Swap With The Aggregator API ](../developer-guides/execute-a-swap-with-the-aggregator-api.md)for examples on how to integrate with our APIs.

KyberSwap Aggregator maintains a single API specification for all EVM swaps:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="evm-swaps.md"><strong>EVM Swaps</strong></a></td><td></td><td></td><td><a href="evm-swaps.md">evm-swaps.md</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

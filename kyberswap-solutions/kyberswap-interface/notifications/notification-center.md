# Notification Center

## Introduction

The notification center functions as the control panel for all KyberSwap notifications. In addition to having a view of all notifications within a single page, the notification centre allows users to subscribe to multiple [notification types](./#types-of-notifications), configure notification thresholds, and redirect notifications to their [preferred channels](./#notification-channels).

## Notification quick view

The KyberSwap Interface enables users to conveniently peek the latest notifications for their connected account via the UI. Users of the KyberSwap UI will be notified via the bell icon for any KyberSwap related notifications, be it for customized alerts which are delivered via "My inbox" or KyberSwap updates which are delivered via "General".

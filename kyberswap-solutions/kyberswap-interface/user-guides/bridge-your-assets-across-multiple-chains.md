## Bridge your token from one chain to the next

### Step 1: Connect to the destination chain

Select the chain which you are bridging to by using KyberSwap's chain selector tool.&#x20;

If this is the first time connecting to a specific chain, you will have to approve adding the network provider to your wallet's list of providers.

### Step 2: Open the KyberSwap menu

Once connected to the target network, you can then access the native bridges via the menu in the top right.

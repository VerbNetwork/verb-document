# User Guides

The following user guides are targeted at KyberSwap Elastic liquidity providers and covers the end-to-end flow from liquidity provision, yield farming, and liquidity position exits. This section was created as the liquidity provision steps differs between Classic and Elastic.&#x20;

If you're still unsure which protocol best suites your needs, you can visit the [Classic vs Elastic](../../classic-vs-elastic/) page. Alternatively, you can start at the beginning of your yield generation journey by visiting [Earn Yield By Contributing Liquidity](../../../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-interface/user-guides/earn-yield-by-contributing-liquidity.md).

For all other use cases (swaps, wallet management, etc.) please refer to the [User Guides](../../../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-interface/user-guides/) section under KyberSwap Interface.

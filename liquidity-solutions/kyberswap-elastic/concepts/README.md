# Concepts

KyberSwap Elastic's key contributions towards the AMM space are its aggregation of different amplified liquidity (DMM) positions into a single pool as well as the introduction of a reinvestment curve which auto-compounds previously idle concentrated liquidity fees.

Collectively, these concepts forms the Dynamic Automated Market Making v2 (DMMv2) protocol invented by the KyberSwap research team. You can refer to the [Dynamic Market Making v2 whitepaper ](../../../getting-started/whitepapers.md#kyberswap-elastic)for an overview of the protocol or the [DMMv2 Technical Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F50RWQRRyaNxnW5RvKgw09fN2FofIVLVccijgcOt-Iw/edit#heading=h.i0grrivqtzgw) for an even deeper dive.

The following sections outline these concepts at a high level:

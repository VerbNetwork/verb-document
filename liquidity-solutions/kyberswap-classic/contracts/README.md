# Contracts

In keeping to our core principle of building open and trustless financial infrastructure, this section explains in greater detail the KyberSwap Classic smart contract implementation. Moreover, the relevant code repositories and deployed contract addresses are also provided to enable anyone to verify the integrity of our code.&#x20;

Rest assured that we are committed to building anti-fragile systems as we continue to integrate the latest security and safety mechanisms into our contracts.&#x20;

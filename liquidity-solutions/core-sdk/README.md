# Core SDK

## Overview

The KyberSwap Core SDK enables the safe handling of various data types (assets, math, etc.) when interacting with Elastic and Classic smart contracts in a TypeScript environment. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the Elastic SDK and Classic SDK.

The Core SDK takes an OOP approach and defines various Classes which abstracts the complexities of data handling. Please refer to the [Classes](classes/) section for the list of classes defined by the Core SDK.

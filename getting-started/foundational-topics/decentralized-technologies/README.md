# Decentralized Technologies

There are a whole range of decentralized technologies which makes what we do here at KyberSwap possible. As our focus lies in making decentralized swaps accessible to all, we realized early on that KyberSwap will be able to generate the most value-add for users at the decentralized application layer. Consequently, we have decided to leverage the expertise of various decentralized infrastucture providers by integrating and building on top of their respective ecosystems.

Critically, this process of integration is contingent upon KyberSwap maintaining its open and permissionless nature. To this end, the sections below outlines some of the key decentralized technology topics where significant consideration was required when designing KyberSwap solutions.

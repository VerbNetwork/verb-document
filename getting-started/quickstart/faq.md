<details>

<summary>What fees do I need to pay to use KyberSwap?</summary>

#### Network Fees

KyberSwap is a fully onchain service. Everyone who creates transactions on the blockchain will need to pay network fees associated with their transactions. These fees vary depending on

1. The network being used
2. Network congestion at the time
3. Complexity of the smart contract transaction being executed

#### Trading Fees

KyberSwap does not charge fees to users using the protocol to swap tokens. However Liquidity Providers are allowed to set fees on their liquidity pools and traders who choose to use these pools to perform swaps will need to pay trading fees to the LP, along with any associated network fees.

It should be noted that of these Trading Fees collected by LPs, [10% goes to KyberSwap’s governance DAO](../../governance/kyberdao/fees-to-kyberdao.md), KyberDAO.

## Accounts and wallets

<details>

<summary>How do I create an account</summary>

As a decentralized platform, KyberSwap does not offer users “accounts” in the traditional sense. We do not store your private data and all transactions on our platform take place through the use of [Web3 wallets](../foundational-topics/decentralized-technologies/wallets.md).

Connecting your Web3 wallet to the KyberSwap platform will enable you to use the full suite of KyberSwap's onchain features. For more information on how to connect your wallet to KyberSwap, please refer to [this article](../../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-interface/user-guides/connect-your-wallet.md).

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to connect or disconnect a Web3 wallet</summary>

Please refer to [Connect Your Wallet](../../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-interface/user-guides/connect-your-wallet.md) for a step-by-step guide on connecting your Web3 wallet with KyberSwap. You can also visit [Wallets](../foundational-topics/decentralized-technologies/wallets.md) to learn more about Web3 wallets and their implementation.

<summary>How to change RPC in Metamask</summary>

If you are facing any transaction delays or if data is taking too long to load on KyberSwap, it could be due to congestion on the blockchain network that you are using. Since some Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints may be more congested than others at a given time, so changing the RPC endpoint URL that your web3 wallet uses to connect to the network may sometimes give a better experience.

In this guide, we will show you how to specify an alternate RPC endpoint for **Metamask** to connect to the **Polygon network.**

**Step 1**: Open your Metamask wallet and click on “My accounts” (the circular button at the top right of the window) and then click on “Settings”.

<img src="https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/article_attachments/14435445235865" alt="001a_MyAccountsCircularButton.png" data-size="original">

<img src="https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/article_attachments/14435414408857" alt="001b_Settings.png" data-size="original">

**Step 2**: Go to Networks and click the “Add Network” button.

<img src="https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/article_attachments/14435414474905" alt="002a_Networks.png" data-size="original">

<img src="https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/article_attachments/14435445381913" alt="002c_AddNetworkButton.png" data-size="original">

This will open up a browser tab with more Metamask Settings.

**Step 3**: Click “Add a network manually” to proceed.

<img src="https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/article_attachments/14435414534169" alt="003a_BrowserTab.png" data-size="original">

**Step 4**: On the screen that appears, specify the new network. For the purposes of this guide we are going to specify an alternate Polygon Mainnet connection setting named “Polygon Mainnet 2”.

Under “New RPC URL” change the URL to the RPC URL that you would like to use. (For a list of public RPC URLs and private RPC providers on the Polygon network, please refer to [Polygon’s wiki](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/network-details/endpoints/).) For this example we’re using [`https://polygon-rpc.com`](https://polygon-rpc.com/)

Click the “Save” button when you are done.

<img src="https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/article_attachments/14435445460249" alt="003b_AddNetworkManually.png" data-size="original">

The newly defined network that uses the new RPC should now appear in your Networks list.

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>I cannot connect my Metamask wallet</summary>

Metamask is one of the most popular web3 wallets among KyberSwap users, so it can be surprising to find that Metamask sometimes cannot be selected to use with [KyberSwap.com](http://kyberswap.com/): the “Connect” button either does nothing or the Metamask option is simply greyed out and unselectable on the “Connect your Wallet” screen. This is not intended behavior.

<img src="https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/article_attachments/14344808346777" alt="MetaMaskUnselectable.png" data-size="original">

There are a couple of things you can try to resolve this.

1. Ensure that the Metamask extension is installed on your browser.
2. Ensure that your Metamask wallet is unlocked with your password. Your wallet extension may also be waiting for confirmation from you to connect to KyberSwap.
3. If you have either or both **Trust Wallet** and/or **Coin98** wallet extensions installed, go into their extension settings and disable the options making them the default wallet. These wallet extensions have been known to set themselves as the default wallet, overriding other wallets like Metamask.&#x20;

If these steps do not solve the problem, please take screenshots of what you’re seeing and contact [Support](https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

<summary>What is impermanent loss?</summary>

Impermanent loss is a temporary loss of funds brought about by the differences in token ratios when entering and exiting an AMM liquidity pool. In short, it is the difference in value between holding both assets versus providing those assets as liquidity.

Please refer to [Impermanent Loss ](../foundational-topics/decentralized-finance/impermanent-loss.md)for an overview of impermanent loss and how it affects your liquidity positions.

<summary>How do I restore my old KyberSwap App wallet?</summary>

KyberSwap used to have an app with a web3 wallet, but support for that app was discontinued as of 30 June 2021. The app is now obsolete.

<img src="https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/article_attachments/14394340012057" alt="KyberSwapAppObsolete.png" data-size="original">

If you still have this app installed on your device, you will find that it is no longer possible to send funds using the app. However, as is the case with any web3 wallet, you can simply restore the wallet to a different web3 wallet client (e.g. Metamask) using the KyberSwap app wallet’s backup secret. To avoid permanent loss of funds, we recommend that you endeavor to do this as soon as possible.

To find your backup secret, simply follow the following steps in the app.

**Step 1**: Tap on Settings > Manage Wallets

**Step 2**: Tap on the wallet you would like to back up

**Step 3**: Tap Edit > Show Backup Phrase

**Step 4**: When prompted, enter your app Passcode

**Step 5**: Tap “Choose your backup method” > Continue

If your wallet was imported, the app will provides two backup methods: Keystore & Private Key.

If your wallet was created in the KyberSwap app, the app will provide three backup methods: Keystore, Private Key, or 12-word Seed phrase.

Once you have obtained your secret, **keep it safe and do not share it with anyone else**. Use the secret to restore your wallet to an up-to-date web3 wallet client and you will once again have access to your funds.

<summary>How to report scam or phishing Google Ads?</summary>

It’s common for scammers and bad actors to buy ads to promote their phishing websites to impersonate reputable exchanges like [KyberSwap.com](http://kyberswap.com/) in an effort to steal your hard-earned crypto.

<img src="https://support.kyberswap.com/hc/article_attachments/14606972086041" alt="000_LookAtTheScams.png" data-size="original">

Other than their sketchy URLs, these websites greatly resemble [KyberSwap.com](http://kyberswap.com/), but if you connect your wallet to their dubious smart contracts you might lose all your crypto. Please be vigilant and always check the URL to ensure that you are trading on the legitimate [KyberSwap.com](http://kyberswap.com/).

If you would like to help us keep our community safe, you can contribute by reporting these scam ads to Google by following these steps:

**Step 1**: Click on the triangle next to the scam ad. This will open the My Ad Center screen.

At Kyber, we strongly believe in working together with other players in the ecosystem. Developers can build their own innovative applications and interact with our protocol implementation to leverage the shared liquidity pool â€” creating a world where any token can be used anywhere.

The three main categories of users of the Kyber protocol are:

1. DApps
2. Vendors
3. Wallets

The figure below shows some of the projects that have integrated with Kyber.

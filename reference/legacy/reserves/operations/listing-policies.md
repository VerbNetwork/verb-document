# Listing Policies

{% hint style="warning" %}
You are referring to the **`Legacy`** version of KyberSwap docs.

For the most updated information, please refer to:

* [**`Classic`**](../../../../liquidity-solutions/kyberswap-classic/)
* [**`Elastic`**](../../../../liquidity-solutions/kyberswap-elastic/)
* [**`Limit Order`**](../../../../kyberswap-solutions/limit-order/)
* [**`Aggregator`**](../../../../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-aggregator/)
{% endhint %}

There are few requirements to have your token listed on Kyber Network:

1. The token is an ERC20 token.
2. Legal opinion that the token is a **utility token**, based on Malta law.
3. The legal opinion should come from a licensed Law Firm in its respective jurisdiction.
4. Liquidity has to be provided for the token. This is done by being a permissioned token reserve, or by using an existing 3rd party reserve that is already integrated with Kyber.
5. Complete [this listing form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KJfKn3oFhz\_puutC5ciQPiPMJlJ1JSKEIjD3t5HKC-8/edit)
6. A **deposit of USD $1000 worth of KNC** as commitment towards this listing process, because considerable effort is required on both parties. The funds will be returned once the token goes live on KyberSwap.

### Policies[​](https://docs.kyberswap.com/Legacy/reserves/operation/listing-policies#policies) <a href="#policies" id="policies"></a>

* **Transparency**: All operations that occur on the Kyber protocol can be publicly verified on the blockchain.
* **Non-custodial**: At no point does the Kyber protocol control the funds of its users. Hence, users' funds will not be affected even in hacking incidents.
* **Instant Confirmation**: A transaction happens with instant confirmation if it's sent from on-chain entities like smart contracts. Otherwise, once the transaction is included on the blockchain, the execution triggered by the transaction is immediately confirmed.
* **Operation Certainty**: There are no transactional risks. Users know the rate and how much liquidity is available before they commit their transaction. There is no settlement uncertainty or counterparty risk.
* **On-chain Settlement**: Atomic and immediate on-chain settlement of trades.
* **Reserve Managers control their reserves**: Reserves also keep and contribute liquidity for their token via smart contracts that they control (source code prepared, tested and provided by us).
* **Code Audits**: Kyber’s smart contracts have also been audited and verified by [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/), an audit platform for smart contracts. Read the full audit report here: \<NEW\_AUDIT\_LINK>
